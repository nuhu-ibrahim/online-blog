What is Symfony
###################

Symfony is an Open Source PHP framework for developing web applications. It was originally conceived by the interactive agency SensioLabs for the development of web sites for its own customers. Symfony was published in 2005 under MIT Open Source license and today it is among the leading frameworks available for PHP development.

Supported by SensioLabs - but also by a large community - Symfony provides many resources: plentiful documentation, community support (mailing lists, IRC, etc.), professional support (consulting, training, etc.), and so on.

Thousands of web sites and applications rely on the Symfony framework and the Symfony components as the foundation of their web services. And most of the leading PHP projects, such as Drupal, phpBB, Laravel and eZ Publish use Symfony components to build their applications.
