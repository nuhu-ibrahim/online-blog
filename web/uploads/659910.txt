    e.g 0108-0100 ... note that they are in hexadecimal
-- h 0108 0100 to find the difference on command prompt
-- store the length in to the register e.g cx by rcx then the legth
-- to save type n fileName.com
-- then w to finally write it into memory
-- when you want to load a file, use n Filename then l
-- To view all commands, use u command followed by the starting of the register then the end
	e.g u 01000 01008
-- Q helps in closing the debug
